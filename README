ABOUT:
libpepper is a libary for creating games. Mostly, it is a collection of the
work that we assumed we would be remaking for most of our games. So far,
it consists of the following main components, all within the Pepper
namespace:
	-Geometry
	-Video
	-Game

DIRECTORIES:
	src/	-source files
	test/	-test suites
